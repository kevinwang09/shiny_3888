# Lecture outline

+ Case scenario: Sydney airport dashboard
+ It all begins with a RMarkdown
+ Inputs and outputs of a Shiny app
+ Demo 1: `bomrang` Shiny app - wind plot
+ Demo 2: `bomrang` Shiny app - temperature plot and `reactive`
+ Demo 3: `bomrang` Shiny app - deployment
+ COVID-19 Shiny app - reproducibility 
+ Tips and resources for Shiny

# Case study: issuing wind warnings

+ Imagine that you are working at Sydney airport as a data scientist

+ You are responsible for issuing wind speed warnings whenever the windspeed reaches 30km/h (or above) in the past 72 hours

# `bomrang`

.scroll-output[
```{r, fig.width = 14}
library(bomrang)

SYD_weather = get_current_weather("Sydney airport")

SYD_weather %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
             y = wind_spd_kmh)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(x = "Time", 
       y = "Wind (km/h)",
       title = "SYD airport wind speed")
```

# Wind warning

Basic steps:
.pull-left[
1. Loading relevant `R` packages
1. Fetch BOM data for Sydney airport for the past 72 hours
1. Making a time series using ggplot2 and flag wind warning
1. Pass the report to your boss
]

--

Challenges: 

.pull-right[
1. To use this system, you need to set up R and packages
1. Your data might not be up-to-date if you are not physically in front of a laptop pressing the knit button
1. You will end up generating/storing a lot of reports for your boss
1. Sydney airport is hard-coded, so what happens if Melbourne airport also wants a similar system

# Why use a dashboard?

+ To communicate results easily to non-experts

+ Think of a Rmd document as three components: 

    1. Input (often the data)
    1. Analysis (making plots, hypothesis testing, statistical modelling)
    1. Outputs (interperting plots, making recommendations)

+ Users are typically non-experts in the analysis, but they are experts in understanding the inputs and outputs.

+ Hence, if the inputs and outputs of a set of analysis are set and determined, a dashboard system can help the users to obtain their results much faster

+ Additionally, a dashboard is typically live and can fetch real-time data. A Rmd file only captures a snapshop of the live data.

# Shiny app in a Rmd file

Go ahead and knit `bomrang.Rmd`, you will get a basic Shiny app!

Input: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
{{inputPanel(}}
  textInput(inputId = "location",
                   label = "Put a location here!",
                   value = "Sydney airport")
{{)}}
```

Output: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
{{renderPlot({}}
  weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
  
  weather %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
               y = wind_spd_kmh)) +
    geom_path() +
    labs(x = "Time", 
         y = "Wind (km/h)")
{{})}}
```
