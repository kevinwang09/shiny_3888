# Case study: issuing wind warnings

+ Imagine that you are working at Sydney airport as a data scientist

+ You are responsible for issuing wind speed warnings whenever the windspeed reaches 30km/h (or above) in the past 72 hours

# `bomrang`

.scroll-output[
```{r, fig.width = 14}
library(bomrang)

SYD_weather = get_current_weather("Sydney airport")

SYD_weather %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
             y = wind_spd_kmh)) +
  geom_path() +
  labs(x = "Time", 
       y = "Wind (km/h)",
       title = "SYD airport wind speed")
```
]

# Wind warning

Basic steps:
.pull-left[
1. Loading relevant `R` packages
1. Fetch BOM data for Sydney airport for the past 72 hours
1. Making a time series using ggplot2 and flag wind warning
1. Pass the report to your boss
]

--

Challenges: 

.pull-right[
1. To use this system, you need to set up R and packages
1. Your data might not be up-to-date if you are not physically in front of a laptop pressing the knit button
1. You will end up generating/storing a lot of reports for your boss
1. Sydney airport is hard-coded, so what happens if Melbourne airport also wants a similar system
]

# Why use a dashboard?

+ To communicate results easily to non-experts

+ Think of a Rmd document as three components: 

    1. Input (often the data)
    1. Analysis (making plots, hypothesis testing, statistical modelling)
    1. Outputs (interperting plots, making recommendations)

+ Users are typically non-experts in the analysis, but they are experts in understanding the inputs and outputs.

+ Hence, if the inputs and outputs of a set of analysis are set and determined, a dashboard system can help the users to obtain their results much faster

+ Additionally, a dashboard is typically live and can fetch real-time data. A Rmd file only captures a snapshop of the live data.

Shiny = input + R + output

Once you know how to manage the inputs/outputs of your app, you are already halfway there!

# Shiny app in a Rmd file (not a full app)

Go ahead and knit `bomrang.Rmd`, you will get a basic Shiny app!

Input: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
*inputPanel(
  textInput(inputId = "location",
                   label = "Put a location here!",
                   value = "Sydney airport")
*)
```

Output: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
*renderPlot({
  weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
  
  weather %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
               y = wind_spd_kmh)) +
    geom_path() +
    labs(x = "Time", 
         y = "Wind (km/h)")
*})

# Inputs and outputs

+ Inputs
    - Time of data accession
    - Location 
+ Analysis
    - Loading packages 
    - Make a ggplot 
    - Determine if a wind warning should be issued
+ Outputs
    - Show the ggplot

# A Shiny app is made up of two `.R` scripts

+ Inputs
    - Special function managing inputs in `ui.R`
+ Analysis
    - Write normal `R` codes in `server.R`
+ Outputs
    - Special function managing outputs in `ui.R`

Demo 1: Let's build your first Shiny app!
---

# `ui.R`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
*shinyUI(
*    fluidPage(
        textInput(inputId = "location",
                  label = "Put a location here!",
                  value = "Sydney airport"),
        plotOutput(outputId = "wind_plot")
*    )
*)
```
---

# `server.R`

+ The inputs as determined from `ui.R` are passed to `server.R`, named `input`
+ You can access these inputs using `input$inputId`
+ The outputs as processed by `server.R` are passed to `ui.R`, named `output`
+ You can access these ouputs using `output$outputId`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
* shinyServer(function(input, output) {
*    output$wind_plot = renderPlot({
      weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
        weather %>% 
          ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
                     y = wind_spd_kmh)) +
          geom_path() +

`reactive`: a key concept in Shiny apps

---

# This `server.R` will fail. Why?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
    output$wind_plot = renderPlot({
        weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
        weather %>% 
            ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
                       y = wind_spd_kmh)) +
            geom_path() +
            labs(x = "Time", 
                 y = "Wind (km/h)")
    })
    
    output$temp_plot = renderPlot({
*        weather %>% 
*            ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
*                       y = apparent_t)) +
*            geom_path() +
*            labs(x = "Time", 
*                 y = "Apparent Temp (Celcius)")
    })
})
```

---
# `reactive` values

+ `renderPlot` (and other types of `render*`) are called "reactive" functions. Meaning they will react to changes to the `input`. 

+ Without it, you will get an error message like this: 

```
Error in .getReactiveEnvironment()$currentContext() : 
  Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. 
  (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)
```

+ Being `R` functions, the values you computed internally inside one `renderPlot` will not be shared with another `renderPlot` function (or any function for that matter)

---
# This `server.R` will work, but why it is a bad idea?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
    output$wind_plot = renderPlot({
*      weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
        weather %>% 
            ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
                       y = wind_spd_kmh)) +
            geom_path() +
            labs(x = "Time", 
                 y = "Wind (km/h)")
    })
    
    output$temp_plot = renderPlot({
*      weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
        weather %>% 
            ggplot(aes(x = local_date_time_full,
                       y = apparent_t)) +
            geom_path() +
            labs(x = "Time", 
                 y = "Apparent Temp (Celcius)")
    })
})
```

---
# `reactive` function

+ We need a general function that will react to our inputs. That is the `reactive()` function!

+ Consider the following scenario: you want to make a plot for windspeed and another for temperature. 

+ We just saw that we need to re-fetch the data every time we draw a plot. 

+ But this is inefficient! It is better to download the data once and have that data available for every plotting function.
---
# `reactive` in action

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
    
*    fetch_data = reactive({
*        weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
*        return(weather)
*    })
    
    output$wind_plot = renderPlot({
        fetch_data() %>% 
            ggplot() ## etc
    })
    
    output$temp_plot = renderPlot({
        fetch_data() %>% 
            ggplot() ## etc
    })
    
})
```
---
# `actionButton` and `eventReactive`

+ When we type out the phrase "Sydney airport", you notice the plots change immediately. 
+ However, this actually isn't ideal: many fetches of the data will be executed as your type out the letters.
+ This could be a problem if the computation is really computationally intensive or makes too many API requests to an external server. 
+ You could use an `actionButton()` in the `ui.R`, which, upon clicking, changes the value of `input$button`.
+ `eventReactive` in `server.R` will be set up such that every change in the value of `input$button` will trigger the computation of some code. 
---
# `actionButton` and `eventReactive`

+ `ui.R`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  ...
*    actionButton(inputId = "button", label = "Fetch data and plot")
  ...
))
```

+ `server.R`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
    
*  fetch_data = eventReactive(input$button, {
        weather = get_current_weather(input$location)
        return(weather)
    })
...
})
```
---

# `observe()` changes the internal values objects (extension)

+ Unlike `reactive()`, the `observe()` will change the internal values of `R` objects.

+ Try adding this code to `server.R` and see what happens in the console. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
obs = observe({
        print(
            paste0(input$location, " is fun!")
        )
    })
```

+ A special case of `observe()` is `observeEvent()`, see some uses in context of `actionButton()` [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/action-buttons.html). 

---

# `global.R` will always run when you launch a Shiny app


+ A good place to put in codes like:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bomrang)
library(tidyverse)
library(forecast)

theme_set(theme_bw())

customised_function = function(...){
  ...
}
```

---

# Deploying your app

+ You can share your app via shinyapps.io.
  - Hosts up to 5 applications and 25 active hours per month.

+ Alternatively, you can put the Shiny scripts on GitHub. 
  - People need to run the app locally on their laptop with all necessary packages installed. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(shiny)
library(forecast)
library(ggrepel)
library(nCov2019)
## devtools::install_github("GuangchuangYu/nCov2019")

shiny::runGitHub(
    repo = "covid19", 
    username = "kevinwang09", 
    ref = "master")
```
