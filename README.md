# Acknowledgements

+ The [ncov_3888](ttps://github.com/kevinwang09/ncov_3888) app was built upon the [nCov2019](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019) package.

+ The [catdog_3888](https://github.com/kevinwang09/catdog_3888) app was inspired by https://adamspannbauer.github.io/2018/02/14/image-classification-r-and-python/ and https://gerinberg.com/2019/12/10/image-recognition-keras/. Some simplifications of the codes were made inside the app.
